    "I was burnt out at my old job and desperate to make a change, it was clear that I needed to learn a new skill set. I needed high-quality learning materials and support but didn’t have much money. Thankfully, a coworker told me about Code Command. Their rates were less than half of other comparable programs, so I was skeptical at first. Since Code Command offers a 90-day money back guarantee, I decided to give them a try. That was the best decision I ever made, because now I’m living my truth as an iOS app developer earning twice the salary at my old job! ",
